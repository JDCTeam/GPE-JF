# GPE-JF
This is the Google Play Edition ROM for the jflte device tree, including jfltexx, jfltetmo, jflteatt and jfltespr

# How-To

Building for Linux is the required method, as this allows you to build the kernel with the ROM if you require, and it is easier for me to maintain as I use Linux primarily (almost exclusively). Going forward, the Windows building method will just build a ROM with whatever is on the repo. If you want the latest features, [fire up a VM](http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Ubuntu-on-VirtualBox) and use Linux.

To do that follow the [Linux building instructions](docs/LINUX.md).
